This is a shirt customiser Web App using Three JS and react JS for 3D models using the React Three Fiber library . 
I also implemented the DALL.E API to generate short logos and the whole shirt design.
The repository is public so you can add new features to improve the web application.
Some of the packages that are used here are old. There are new versions available so while changing them, you have to modify the code accordingly. Otherwise some features might break.
